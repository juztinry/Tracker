# GitHub Upload Instructions

Since we couldn't use Git directly through the interface, here are manual instructions to upload your project to GitHub:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Open GitHub Desktop and log in with your GitHub account
3. Click on "File" > "Add local repository" and select your project folder (C:\xampp\htdocs\Tracker)
4. If it's not a Git repository yet, it will prompt you to initialize it
5. In the repository settings, set the remote URL to: https://github.com/juztinry/Tracker.git
6. Create your first commit with a message like "Initial commit with login and dashboard"
7. Click on "Push origin" to upload your code to GitHub

## Option 2: Using Git Command Line (after installing Git)

1. Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
3. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd C:\xampp\htdocs\Tracker
   ```
4. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```
5. Add all files to the staging area:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
6. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit with login and dashboard"
   ```
7. Add the remote repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/juztinry/Tracker.git
   ```
8. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (If your default branch is called "master" instead of "main", use "master" instead)

## Option 3: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/juztinry/Tracker
2. If the repository is empty, you'll see an option to upload files
3. Click on "uploading an existing file"
4. Drag and drop your project files or use the file selector
5. Add a commit message like "Initial commit with login and dashboard"
6. Click "Commit changes"

Note: The web interface has limitations for uploading many files at once, so Options 1 or 2 are recommended.

## Files to Exclude

Make sure not to upload:
- node_modules folders
- .env files with sensitive information
- build or dist folders
- Any other files listed in the .gitignore file

## Important Files to Include

Make sure to include:
- All source code files
- package.json files
- README.md
- .gitignore
- Configuration files (except those with sensitive information)
